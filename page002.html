<p class="subtitle"> First of all let's go through what is wrong with your current life-work balance:</p>
<ul class="text" style="color: lightsalmon; font-weight: lighter">
  <li>You wake up at 7 am to get on 9 am at work</li>
  <li>You work until 5pm and you comute home</li>
  <li>You get home by 7 pm.</li>
  <li>You are tired, and if you drink coffee you won't be able to sleep at night</li>
  <li>You do some shallow tasks that needs to be done, and crawl into bed</li>
  <li>You are a fucking idiot of a human, so you grab your phone and start scrolling Instagram reels -
    <br>those memes are really worth it ain't it?</li>
  <li>The clock hits 10PM and you say to yourself <span style="color: #b3d4fc; font-weight: bolder">"Just 10 more minutes and than i turn it off"</span></li>
  <li>Guess fucking what? You didn't turned it off.</li>
  <li>You go to sleep with tears in your eyes that tomorrow you will be sleep deprived.</li>
</ul>
<p class="text"><span style="color: #b3d4fc; font-weight: bolder">What a terrible life to live</span></p>
<p class="text">The slaves from the 1800's were better on mental health than 9 to 5 workers.</p>


<div class="center">
  <img class="special" src="Webpage_photos/poor.jpg" alt="Fire/Heat Source">
</div>



<p class="subtitle"> You may ask "Alright bro, but how can i fix my eternally fucked life?"</p>
<p class="text"><span style="color: #b3d4fc; font-weight: bolder">Here is the only method that works!</span></p>
<p class="text">I used this method in every hardship in my life!</p>
<p class="text">When i decided that i want to go to university i came to a harsh realization:</p>
<p class="text">I want to learn software-hardware development but i DON'T know shit about computers?</p>
<p class="text">keep in mind that i was a full 9-5 worker at this time.</p>
<p class="text">I developed the METHOD at this time.</p>
<p class="text"><span style="color: #b3d4fc; font-weight: bolder">And that shit worked, i did see the progress.</span></p>
<p class="text">And from someone who could barely do multiplications in head, i got accepted in the best university in the country.</p>


<div class="center">
  <img class="special" src="Webpage_photos/kill.jpg" alt="Fire/Heat Source">
</div>

<p class="subtitle"> Than when i started the first trimester i got complacent.</p>
<p class="text">I didn't use the basics that made so much progress for me.</p>
<p class="text">DING- DONG!</p>
<p class="text">Exams incoming, i only have 3 weeks to relearn the whole trimester, what the fuck shall a dumbass like me do?</p>
<p class="text"><span style="color: #b3d4fc; font-weight: bolder">Than i remembered</span></p>
<p class="text">I shall go back to my fundamentals,</p>
<p class="text">And use my <span style="color: #b3d4fc; font-weight: bolder">METHOD</span></p>
<p class="text"><span style="color: deeppink; font-weight: bolder">And guess what? It worked again.</span></p>
<p class="text">I still can't belive it.</p>
<p class="text">I was the only one in my class that passed.</p>
<p class="text">This <span style="color: #b3d4fc; font-weight: bolder">METHOD</span> is amazing, i don't try to sell you shit or to make you buy my onlyfans subscription or some shit.</p>
<p class="text">This will help.</p>
<p class="text"><span style="color: #b3d4fc; font-weight: bolder">100% testicle guarantee!</span></p>





<p class="subtitle"> "But ShepherdMike what is this so called method you are talking about?"</p>
<p class="text">Okay listen to me, grab a pen and paper.</p>

<div class="center">
  <img class="special" src="Webpage_photos/pen.jpg" alt="Fire/Heat Source">
</div>


<p class="subtitle">THE METHOD:</p>
<p class="text">Firstly you must change the sleep cycle. <span style="color: #b3d4fc; font-weight: bolder">You will be sleep deprived anyway, why not use it to your advantage?</span></p>
<p class="text">From waking up at 7 bring the timer back with 2 hours.</p>
<br><br>
<p class="text"><span style="color: #b3d4fc; font-weight: bolder">When you have the goal that it is worth sacrificing for</span> <br>
  <br>(creating a side hustle, planning a business, learning a new skill, crawling through the exams, etc..)</p>
<p class="text">you shall do <span style="color: #b3d4fc; font-weight: bolder">the following.</span></p>
<p class="text"><span style="color: deeppink; font-weight: bolder">Set a timer at 5 am</span>, and without snoozing get up from the bed!</p>
<p class="text">I know it is hard, <span style="color: #b3d4fc; font-weight: bolder">cry about it,</span> <br>
  <br>Are you so weak of a person that you will not sacrifice for your own goals? For real?</p>

<br><br>
<p class="text"><span style="color: lime; font-weight: bolder">"But Mike, it is so hard to get up in the morning"</span></p>
<p class="text">I understand you, i had trouble waking up too, many times i slept in, or ignored the alarm.</p><br>
<p class="text">But to progress in this you shall do 2 things:</p>

<ul class="text">
  <li><span style="color: lightsalmon; font-weight: bolder">Morning caffeine</span></li>
  <li><span style="color: lightsalmon; font-weight: bolder">No weekends</span></li>
</ul>
<br>


<p class="text">Before you go to bed, in the night, <span style="color: #b3d4fc; font-weight: bolder">prepare a shot of expresso next to your alarm clock.</span></p><br>
<p class="text">When you wake up in the morning,<br><br> <span style="color: #b3d4fc; font-weight: bolder">you shall control your mind and command it to reach for that cup right after turning off your alarm.</span></p>
<br><br><p class="text">Yes it ain't the most healthy choice because it gives you a tummy ache for 3 minutes.</p>
<p class="text">Be a man for fucks sake!</p>
<p class="text">It is so worth it.</p>
<br><br><p class="text"><span style="color: #b3d4fc; font-weight: bolder">Don't forget that your arms are controlled by your brain.</span>
  <span style="color: deeppink; font-weight: bolder"> You control your own life, and NOT your emotions.</span></p>
<p class="text">If i could do it so can you.</p>


<br><br>

<p class="text">The thing about waking up early is that it doesn't get easier with time. <span style="color: #b3d4fc; font-weight: bolder">Or does it?</span></p>
<br><br>
<p class="text">There is only one way how you can make waking up early <span style="color: #b3d4fc; font-weight: bolder">an automatic task, that your body does for you.</span></p>
<br><br><p class="text"><span style="color: deepskyblue; font-weight: bolder">You must do it everyday.</span></p>
<br><br>
<p class="text">After 28 days (at least for me and my friends who are on the same path) my body was like <span style="color: lime; font-weight: bolder">"Ok i got it, we work from 5"</span></p>
<p class="text">And since then. <span style="color: #b3d4fc; font-weight: bolder">I can wake up at the exact time of 5AM without an alarm.</span></p><br>
<p class="text">And trust me, there is no comparison to when you can wake up in the morning naturally with the sun.</p>
<br><br>

<div class="center">
  <img class="special" src="Webpage_photos/mornin.jpg" alt="Fire/Heat Source">
</div>

<br><br><br>
<p class="text"><span style="color: lime; font-weight: bolder">"But why shall i wake up in the morning?"</span></p>

<p class="text">As we discussed earlier, we will trade the time from 8pm-10pm to morning 5am-7am.</p>
<p class="text">Here you are tired that is true, but<span style="color: #b3d4fc; font-weight: bolder"> your mind is extremely sharp.</span> Combined with the power of <span style="color: #b3d4fc; font-weight: bolder">caffeine.</span>

  <br>You can and will create value.</p>



<br><br>
<p class="text">There is a problem though, <span style="color: lime; font-weight: bolder">in the morning we don't really know what to do out of a sudden</span>, so this is a problem that our <span style="color: #b3d4fc; font-weight: bolder">night selves</span> need to solve.</p>

<p class="subtitle">So here is the second task, PREPARE YOUR TASKLIST.</p>

<div class="center">
  <img class="special" src="Webpage_photos/task.jpg" alt="Fire/Heat Source">
</div>

<br><br><br>
<p class="text">It ain't that hard, but be specific.</p>

<p class="text">My morning list looks something like this:</p>
<ul class="text" style="color: lightsalmon; font-weight: lighter">
  <li>Wake up 5AM</li>
  <li>Brush teeth</li>
  <li>Meditate</li>
  <li>Hate Shower</li>
  <li>Read 1 lesson (from a slow reading book like Meditations, 48 Laws of Power, etc..)<br> (max 40 min because this is the priority for me)</li>
  <li>Quick pushups + abs workout (10-15 min)</li>
  <li>Write an article for my website (the one you are reading right now)</li>
  <li>etc..</li>
</ul>

<p class="text">Put a rectangle after each one and tick it after you are done with it.</p>
<p class="text">Do <span style="color: #b3d4fc; font-weight: bolder">NOT</span> write it on your phone, <span style="color: #b3d4fc; font-weight: bolder">be a real man write it on paper.</span>
  <br> Every night. Again and again.</p><br>

<p class="text">It is so easy to guide yourself in this way.</p>
<p class="text">In the morning <span style="color: #b3d4fc; font-weight: bolder">you don't need to think about what shall you do,</span> instead you can just enter hardwired flow-state.</p>

<br><br>
<p class="text">The actions shall be anything.</p>
<ul class="text" style="color: lightsalmon; font-weight: lighter">
  <li>work on business</li>
  <li>design the logo</li>
  <li>order the products</li>
  <li>customer service</li>
  <li>go train on the ring</li>
  <li>go for a fat burning run</li>
  <li>Learn that new instrument</li>
  <li>Learn that new language</li>
  <li>Learn that new skill</li>
  <li>anything you can think of..</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">This is the same way i create hobbies for myself, I have the idea and just allocate time for it in the morning.</p>

<div class="center">
  <img class="special" src="Webpage_photos/chad.jpg" alt="Fire/Heat Source">

<p class="subtitle"> Tips to succeed:</p>
<ul class="text" style="color: lightsalmon; font-weight: lighter">
  <li>No phone in the morning. <span style="color: red; font-weight: bolder">(TURN IT OFF TOTTALLY)</span></li>
  <p style="margin-left: 2%">You will lose all your brain power and won't make any progress in your tasks. Keep it on silent nonstop, don't let others bullshit disrupt you.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 2%">Your attention is worth so much, have pride in it.</p>
  <li>Meditating 5 minutes each morning.</li>
  <p style="margin-left: 2%">I know it is a clichee but it will help you make better decisions through the day.</p>
  <li>Prepare coffee in advance. <p style="margin-left: 2%">What i like to do, is to make a full bottle of coffee 3-5 shots of expresso, no milk no sugar (you ain't a bitch are you?)
  This way i can fuel my workflow in the morning and the work after the morning, so i am fresh.</p>
  <li>Add some minimal training in the morning between tasks. <p style="margin-left: 2%">It will spike your testosterone, and this will be the second energizer of the day.
  With testosterone in your body, you will feel invincible.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 2%">This is the hormone that makes you dominant aggressive and assertive. <span style="color: #b3d4fc; font-weight: bolder">USE IT FOR GOOD.</span>
  Use it to build protect and teach. Do not end never waste it to virtual life. It will destroy you than.</p>
</ul>



<div class="center">
  <img class="special" src="Webpage_photos/testosterone.jpg" alt="Fire/Heat Source">
</div>

<br><br><br><br>
<p class="text" style="color: white; font-weight: bolder; font-size: 35px">So in conclusion of the earlier, here is the foolproof plan:</p>
<hr>
<p class="subtitle">Before night:</p>
<ul class="text">
  <li>Prepare coffee for the morning</li>
  <li>Prepare your work equipment so you can just "jump in"</li>
  <li>Prepare your complex task list</li>
</ul>
<p class="subtitle">In the morning:</p>
<ul class="text">
  <li>Wake up at 5AM</li>
  <li>Drink a good shot of coffee</li>
  <li>Start the fucking work</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">It is that easy. This is a real cheat code, that separates weaklings from productive men.</p>
<p class="text">I teach people how to build machines and dangerous robots, and this is the mindset that I want all my students to have.</p>
<hr>


<br><br>

<p class="subtitle"> When will this plan NOT work for you?</p>



<ul class="text">
  <li>If you are a wanker.
   <p style="margin-left: 2%; color: pink"> If you fap and squeeze your dick every morning and night, how do you want to become successful? Your seed can create life.
     So keep it in your balls, for weeks and for months if needed. The most disgusting men on the world are wankers. They will never accomplish anything.</p>
  </li>
  <li>If you are a quitter.
    <p style="margin-left: 2%; color: pink">You try my plan for 2 days, you get tired and you quit. You officially train your brain to quit every time it gets a little bit hard.
    Absolutely disgusting. I said 2 weeks, suffer for 2 weeks, and after the 2 weeks you don't see the change, than fine you can label me as you wish,
      but you won't because I know that I am right!</p>
  </li>
  <li>If you set pussy goals.
    <p style="margin-left: 2%; color: pink">One percent better every day. Slow steps. Ain't working here. You must set a hard goal, (read 4 books, get abs, get 50$ online, etc..) and than
      give yourself a realistic deadline. (I shall read 4 self improvement books in the next 4 weeks, each morning I will read for an hour, etc..)</p>
  </li>
  <li>If you are weak.
    <p style="margin-left: 2%; color: pink">It is not enough to be smart, you also need to be strong!
      The country that separates the intellectuals from the warriors, will have the thinking done by cowards and the fighting done by fools.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<br><br><br>
<p class="text">I really want to see you succeed!</p>
<p class="text"><span style="color: #b3d4fc; font-weight: bolder">I was in your shoes, i was miserable, i wasted time too, i had bad habits</span> (that were probably worse than yours)</p>
<p class="text">but if i could change, and get better, so can you.</p>
<p class="text">No one is going to save you, you won't hit the lottery, the only way out is by hard work and discipline.</p>
<p class="text">I really hope i helped you!</p>


<div class="center">

<p class="subtitle"> About me:</p>
